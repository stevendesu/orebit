 * absorption (water / hay / slime — a wider safe drop) arrives with the {@code softLanding} NavBlock
 * fact when that's built; for now the bot won't take a drop it can't walk away from.
 *
 * <p>The landing must be {@link MovementContext#standable} (so it never "lands" in lava/cactus — those
 * aren't standable) and the whole drop column, plus the step-off transit, must be {@link
 * MovementContext#passable}. The highest reachable landing wins (shortest, safest drop). Fall folds no
 * edits (you can't usefully break/place mid-drop), so it never consults {@code RISKY_EDIT}.
